    <h2>From Submarine Galley to Backyard Smoke</h2>
    <p>I spent 20 years as a cook in the U.S. Navy — deep below the ocean, feeding sailors, keeping it simple but damn good. That’s where I learned discipline, heat control, and how to make the most out of whatever I had on hand.</p>

    <p>Now, I run ChowdownBBQ to help regular folks get started in real backyard cooking — without the fluff. If you want glossy influencer recipes or overpriced gear, you’re in the wrong place. But if you want honest talk, tested tools, and food that makes people shut up and chew — you’re home.</p>

    <p>Everything you see here is built for the working man, the weekend warrior, or the curious rookie. Whether you're on your first bag of charcoal or your fifth smoker — welcome aboard.</p>

    <p>– Salty</p>
